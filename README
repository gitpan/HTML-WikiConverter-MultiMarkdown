NAME
    HTML::WikiConverter::MultiMarkdown - Converts HTML to MultiMarkdown
    syntax

SYNOPSIS
        use HTML::WikiConverter::MultiMarkdown;

        my $converter = HTML::WikiConverter::MultiMarkdown->new();

        my $markdown = $converter->html2wiki( html => $html );

DESCRIPTION
    This is a subclass of HTML::WikiConverter::Markdown that output
    MultiMarkdown syntax. The most notable extension MultiMarkdown provides
    for original Markdown is support for tables.

    See http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/ for more information on
    MultiMarkdown.

    For now, this module's implementation is incomplete, and it does not
    support most MultiMarkdown features. Supported features are:

    * tables
        There is basic support for tables. The first row of a table is
        always treated as the header. There is no support for column or row
        groups. There is also no support for captions or summaries.

    * metadata
        The page's `<title>' tag will be turned into a Title metadata item.

    Patches for more syntax feature support are welcome.

METHODS
    See HTML::WikiConverter for usage information.

DONATIONS
    If you'd like to thank me for the work I've done on this module, please
    consider making a "donation" to me via PayPal. I spend a lot of free
    time creating free software, and would appreciate any support you'd care
    to offer.

    Please note that I am not suggesting that you must do this in order for
    me to continue working on this particular software. I will continue to
    do so, inasmuch as I have in the past, for as long as it interests me.

    Similarly, a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on
    this software much more, unless I get so many donations that I can
    consider working on free software full time, which seems unlikely at
    best.

    To donate, log into PayPal and send money to autarch@urth.org or use the
